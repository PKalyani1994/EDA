As known, there is surge in the Global Terrorist Attacks across different countries **since 1970 through 2017 till present**. The Database records more than **1,80,000 Terrorist attacks**. The detailed information about each attack is formulated and presented in the database. The database is maintained by researchers at the **National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START)**, headquartered at the **University of Maryland**. I hereby Explored and analyzed the data to discover key findings pertaining to terrorist activities.\n",

        "4. ISVG continued as the primary collector of data on attacks that occurred from **April 2008 through October 2011**.\n",
        "5. Beginning with cases that occurred in **November 2011**, all ongoing GTD data collection is conducted by **National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START)** staff at the University of Maryland.\n",
